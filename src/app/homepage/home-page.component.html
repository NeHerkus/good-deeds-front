          <p>You can choose activities that seem meaningful and important to you. Let us carefully consider who needs
            our
            time, strength, advice, help, understanding. Let's go to the nearest communities, our native cities, let's
            talk to
            nearby organizations, neighborhoods, hard-working families. Maybe they need help?</p>
